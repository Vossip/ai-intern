# AI Intern

This project is designed and developed in collaboration with [Galadriel](https://github.com/galadriel-ai) to interact with the X API. It fetches tweets, processes them, and saves them locally in a structured format. Additionally, it updates tweet descriptions and manages media links associated with the tweets. The goal of this project is to create a fully autonomous AI agent that can act as an intern on X.

**Version:** 0.0.1

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v10 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Setup

1. **Install Dependencies:**

   Start by installing the necessary Node.js dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Variables:**

   Copy the `template.env` file to `.env` and fill in the necessary environment variables:

   ```bash
   cp config/template.env config/.env
   ```

   Then, open `.env` and replace the placeholders with your actual API keys and other necessary configurations:

   ```dotenv
   BEARER_TOKEN="your_bearer_token"
   CLIENT_ID="your_client_id"
   CLIENT_SECRET="your_client_secret"
   ACCOUNT_ID="your_twitter_account_id"
   ```

3. **Run the Main Script:**

   After setting up your environment variables, run the main script to fetch and process tweets:

   ```bash
   npm run main
   ```

   This will:
   - Fetch tweets from the specified Twitter account.
   - Save the tweets and their associated media links to the `output` folder.

4. **Update Descriptions:**

   To update tweet descriptions with the content from `descriptions.txt`, use the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run update
   ```

5. **Run the Custom Agent (Optional):**

   (This step will be detailed later when the Galadriel custom agent contract is available.)

   You will need to use the Galadriel custom agent contract to run the agent as part of the process. More information will be provided once this step is ready.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains the main TypeScript source files.
  - **clients/**: Holds the Twitter API client.
  - **utils/**: Utility functions for file operations.
  - **main.ts**: The entry point for fetching and processing tweets.
  - **updateDescriptions.ts**: Script to update tweet descriptions based on an external file.

- **output/**: Stores the output files generated by the scripts.
  - `intern-tweets.json`: The structured JSON file of tweets.
  - `links.txt`: A file containing media links extracted from the tweets.
  - `descriptions.txt`: A file containing descriptions to update the tweets.

- **config/**: Contains environment variable configurations.
  - `.env`: Your environment-specific variables.
  - `template.env`: Template for environment variables.

## Important Notes

- Make sure to keep your `.env` file secure as it contains sensitive information like API keys.
- The project is designed to be run in a controlled environment with appropriate API rate limits considered.
